# Objective
As more people were home and hosting virtual dance parties during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sparkify, a fake streaming music app, experienced exponential growth. With the ever-increasing quantity of data and desire to perform more sosphiticated analysis, Sparkify's management decided to store its data in a data lake.

Sparkify's management is growing its data science and machine learning department. One of the company's objectives is to develop the industry-leading music recommender system. To create such a sosphiticated algorithm, the company requires a data management system that is continuously updating and handles vast amounts of data.
