# Objective
As more people were home and hosting virtual dance parties during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sparkify, a fake streaming music app, experienced exponential growth. With the ever-increasing quantity of data and desire to perform more sosphiticated analysis, Sparkify's management decided to store its data in a data lake.

The startup will leverage the capabilities of Spark and Hadoop to enable distributing computing via AWS. Spark creates a cluster manager that oversees the operations of all nodes. This project's cluster mode is **standalone**.

One of the main justifications for transitioning to a data lake is that Sparkify is heavily investing in its recommender system and other ML capabilities. Management wants to develop the industry's best recommender system. By using Spark, the recommender system can be trained at subsantially faster rate.
